# Summary of Guidelines

The following is a summary of the guidelines. The full guidelines always take precedence over this summary in the case of conflicting rules. If you need information on a more specific situation, look at the specific section of the full guidelines.

- Complete the level on the official version on the servers or a copy posted by the Team Omicron (username is `TeamOmicron`) if possible.
- Please check if the list team if you need to make any modifications to the level (e.g., bugfixes, LDMs)
- If you want to use a skip, check with the list team
- The endscreen must be visible in the raw footage of a record, and must be readable (even if you are using a texture pack)
- There should be a readable FPS counters for all records (unless you are on mobile)
- Raw footage is required for every submission, and should contain **no** edits to the original video file
- The raw footage must include audible clicks
- Check the list of [allowed hacks](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xEKmKd2CcACjHtl3ZK4wAzVFzSz9GbpqHPpHisW7498/edit?usp=sharing). They are the same as Pointercrate as of 2023-10-23, except 100% noclip accuracy runs are allowed.
- If you would like to submit a level to be rated on the GDPS or placed on the list, you should read the process in the guidelines, since our system is very different from the one on the normal servers.
