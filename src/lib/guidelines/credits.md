Many of the challenge requirements are taken from the [Challenge List](https://challengelist.gd/challenges/)

The majority of the guidelines are taken from [Pointercrate](https://pointercrate.com/) and rewritten and modified.

The rating and placement system of levels is heavily inspired by the [osu! ranking system](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/Beatmap_ranking_procedure)
