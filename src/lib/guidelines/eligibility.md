# Eligibility

## Video Content
Each record must include a video with uncut footage from the beginning of the level to a given progress point. For example, a record of 72% must include an uncut video from 0% to 72%. Additionally, each record must have a link to the original raw footage (see the raw footage section for more information). The video may be edited as long as the raw footage is not. A record with edited raw footage will never be accepted.

The raw footage should contain audible clicks during the attempt.

If the level is exited in the middle of the attempt, their progress will be treated as if they died at the percentage they exited at. For example, if the player exits the level at 82%, their progress would be 82%.

100% noclip accuracy runs and runs from 0% in practice mode are eligible. If a player exits a level, if the game crashes, or if the player exits the level after the final input (i.e., it is impossible to die even if you click), the run is still eligible.

## 2-Player Levels
2-Player levels are **required** to have a handcam showing both inputs during the entire record. The handcam may be in the raw footage but excluded from the public video.

## Skips
A record may contain skips, and the record may be fully or partially accepted depending on the severity of the skip. There are three types of skips with different severities. If a player uses an illegal skip, the record percentage will be lowered to the percentage of when the skip occurs.

This section describes the three types of skips, however, you should always check if the list team if you intend to use a skip.

## Type I - Always Allowed
A Type I skip is a skip that barely deviates from the original route of the level, and that does not greatly affect the difficulty of a level. A Type I skip will always be accepted, even after it is patched. An example of a Type I skip is 57% in Sonic Wave, where the two blue orbs and be skipped. This is considered a Type I skip since it barely deviates from the original route and does not affect the difficulty in a major way.

## Type II - Allowed if Not Patched
A Type II skip is more significant and bypasses more than just a couple clicks. However the skip is not major enough to change the level's difficulty in any meaningful way.

Type II skips will be accepted unless they are patched in the level on the main servers. Records that use a Type II skip before it is patched will still remain on the list even after it is patched, unless it becomes classified as a Type III skip.

## Type III - Never Allowed
A Type III skip is significant enough to warrant only partially accepting a record. This type of skip and include using a secret way or skipping the hardest part(s) of a level.

## Changing Skip Classifications
In some cases, the classification of a skip may be changed. Records will only be removed if a skip is now considered to be a Type III skip instead of II or I. Records may also be added if the skip decreases in severity.

## Fixing Bugs
Certain framerates may cause parts of a level to become much more difficulty, or impossible. Fixing these types of bugs are allowed as long as the intended difficulty is maintained. You should always check if the list team before applying a bugfix.

## Illegal Bug Fixes
Submitting a record with an illegal bug fix will result in the record being rejected.

## Custom Speed Changes
Some speed changes may cause the music in a level to be desynchronised. Players may add speed changes to fix this only if the difficulty of the entire level remains unchanged. You should always contact the list team if you plan to add extra speed changes.

## Physics Changes
Bugs that result in physics changes from different versions of the game may be fixed as long as the original difficulty remains. As always, check if the list team before applying this type of bugfix.

## Eligibility of Hacks
A player may not submit a record obtained using hacks that alter or bypass the gameplay, such as noclip, speed hacks, or bots.

Players may not use FPS bypass to change the FPS in the middle of an attempt. This applies to other hacks that may affect the difficulty of a level. All records that involve enabling or disabling hacks to change the difficulty of a level will be rejected.

## Mega Hack v7
Players who use Mega Hack v7 must have Cheat Indicator enabled, and the built-in FPS counter enabled.

## Player Bans
Players who intentionally submit hacked records while claiming it as legitimate will be banned from the list. Players may be unbanned after a period of time if they publicly identify their illegitimate records as hacked.

## Framerate Guidelines
Players may choose to use mods to increase the framerate of the game. However, the framerate must remain at or below 360 FPS. Any records that uses a framerate higher than this will be considered illegitimate even if the framerate is obtained through the monitor's refresh rate. Any player that lies about their framerate or fakes an FPS counter will be banned from the list.

Players may change the FPS throughout multiple attempts, but they may not change their FPS mid-attempt.

## FPS Counters
An FPS counter is required for every record submitted to the list (unless you are on mobile). Additionally, those who use Meta Hack version 7.0 and above are required to use the built-in FPS counter. Not having an FPS counter will result in your record being rejected, but you will only be banned if you lie about your FPS.

## Gameplay Changes
Records are not eligible if the gameplay of a level is changed in any way. The only exception is fixing bugs.

## Endscreens
Raw footage that does not contain the in-game endscreen after completing a level will be rejected. The only exception to this rule is if the game crashes, the player dies to a bug, or if the player exits the level, all after the last input a level.

The endscreen should also be visible and easily readable. If the record uses a texture pack that makes the endscreen unreadable, the record will be rejected.

## Game Version
Any record not achieved on the latest version of the game, or the version in which the level was verified will be rejected. For example, records for Bloodbath may be played either on version 1.9, or on the current latest version of the game.


### Important Exception
In the event that Geometry Dash version 2.2 releases, players may choose to play on version 2.1 as it will take some time before mods are ported to the new version. This rule exception may be removed once most mods are ported to 2.2.

## High Suspicion
Some records may be suspicious, but contain no evidence of illegitimacy. This can include a low-quality video cannot be distinguished from an illegitimate completion. In these cases, the record will be rejected, but the player will not be banned, unless evidence of illegitimacy is found.
