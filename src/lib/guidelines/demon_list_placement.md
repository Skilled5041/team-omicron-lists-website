# Demon List Eligibility

A level must be finished qualification and be demon difficulty in order to be considered for placement

A level must be hard enough to be placed on the extended or main list to be eligible to be placed. The only way for a level to be placed on the legacy list is if it is pushed out of the legacy list.

Two-player levels must also be verified by a _single player_ before it can be placed.

Even if a level is rated, it will only be placed if it has a legiitmate verification video. If a level has a hacked verification, it will remain on the list as long as there is at least one legitimate victor. The level host may choose to recognise this victor as the offical verifier.

Verifiers must provide the same proof that a regular victor would. If the verifier fails to meet the guidelines, the first victor may be listed as the verifier instead.

# Timing of Placements

If we receive enough opinions about the difficulty of the level and there is little variation, it will be placed on the Demons List.

A list-worthy level will be placed before 14 days have passed after it is verified and finished qualification.

These guidelines do not apply to that have hacked verifications. The 14 days begins only after there it receives it first legitimate victor.

# Moving levels

Placed levels may be moved if there are enough opinions supporting it.

# Creator Lists

A list of creators listed on the levels page will be provided by the host of the level. If there is a major contributor to the level left out, the list may choose to add this person to the list.

# Removed Verifiers

If the verifier is removed from the rankings, the first victor will be displayed as the verifier.
