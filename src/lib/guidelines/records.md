# Records

## Submitting a Record

To submit a record for any progress or completion of a level, you must include a video or raw footage of an uncut run. The progress of the record must be equal to or greater than the minimum progress requirement listed on the level's page.

The video must be available on YouTube, Twitch, Vimeo, or Bilibili in order for the record to be added to the list. The videos should be not removed at any time (e.g. Twitch automatically deletes stream archives after two weeks).

You can submit records on the website. If you have any questions about this, feel free to contact the list team.

## Legacy Records

Players may submit records for any level on the legacy list.

## Additional Proof

The list team may sometimes ask for additional proof. If the player fails to provide the proof within 5 days, the record will be rejected.

## Rejected Records

If a submitted record does not meet the guidelines, the record will be rejected.
Players can resubmit records with additional proof or with a different completion / progress, even if their previous records have been rejected before. If you feel your record was wrongly rejected, you may contact the list team.

## Manual Record Removal

A player can request to be hidden from the stats viewer at any time. However, they are still visible on the level's leaderboard. You can also request specific records to be removed from a level's leaderboard. You can either choose to have your record hidden or permanently deleted. If a player asks for their record to be removed from a level they have verified, they will be removed from the leaderboard, but it will still display that player as te verifier.

## Multi-accounting and Account Sharing

Players may only have ONE account (on the website) at any given time. If a player is discovered to have multi-accounted, both of their accounts will be banned until the player confesses. Players may only submit their OWN records on their OWN account. You may not submit records for other people, or submit other people's records and claim it as your own. If you are discovered to do so, you will be banned until you confess.
