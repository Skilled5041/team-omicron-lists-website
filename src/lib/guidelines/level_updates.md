# Level Updates

Our rating system ensures that the difficulty of a level does not change too much after updates. As such, records will not be removed after level updates.

## Patching Skips

Some updates to levels may remove skips present in older records. Levels that fix Type II skips will have future records that use it be rejected. Previous records will not be affected.

## New or Updated LDMs

Levels may be updated to include stronger LDMs. When this happens, you may choose to resubmit records previously rejected from having a too strong LDM. These LDMs may now possibility be considered eligible.
