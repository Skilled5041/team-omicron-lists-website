# Getting Your Level Rated or on the List

*This system is inspired by the [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/Beatmap_ranking_procedure) beatmap ranking system*
*This system is experimental and may change in the future*

## Introduction
To get your level placed on any of the lists you need to submit your level on the #submitting forum channel. On that channel you can submit levels that are either fully finished or work in progress. After that the level may be nominated, and eventually qualified. A level should be qualified for at least 3 days before it can be verified.

## Feedback
When a level is in #submit-levels , the creator will be able to give their submission a `Work in Progress` or `Pending` tag. These levels will receive feedback and constructive criticism from the community. They should also be tested to find bugs and other issues. Anyone can provide feedback to these levels, and it is encouraged to do so to improve the quality of levels.

## Nominations
A nomination is a vote of approval that indicates that the quality of a level is sufficient enough for it to be rated or placed on one of the lists.

There are two prerequisites that a level must meet before it can be nominated:
1. It must meet the minimum standards written in the guidelines
2. It must receive at least 3 upvotes (the default post reaction in #submit-levels )

Nominations are given by @⭐️ ⌭ Level Nominator , and you can request your level to be nominated after it meets the 2 requirements. It is highly recommended to receive feedback on a level before asking for a nomination, however it is not required.
## Qualification
Levels that have received two nominations will be moved to #qualified-levels . This channel exists to help levels receive more attention with the hopes of discovering potential problems. Unlike `Work in Progress` or `Pending` levels, levels that are `Qualified` may not be updated. If you wish to update a `Qualified` level, it can only be done after a `nomination reset`

## Nomination Resets
A nomination can be reset when a level is updated or if a @⭐️ ⌭ Level Nominator  finds a problem with the level. Levels can also be reset for other reasons such as when inappropriate content is found in your level. If a level is qualified when its nominations are reset, it will be disqualified and removed for #qualified. If your level gets disqualified, you cans request for it to be nominated again.

## Rating and Placement
Levels that have been qualified for 3 days and that have no problems will be rated (once the GDPS is set up). List placements will follow the list guidelines. Levels that are rated or placed, will only be unrated or removed for the lists under rare circumstances.

## Updating a Rated or Placed Level
Levels that are rated or placed on a list should not have any major gameplay changes. The changes should affect the difficulty of the level as minimally as possible. Bugfixes are allowed.

Decoration may be updated as long as it does not affect the difficulty of the level and if it does not completely change the level.

Coins may be freely added. Coins may also be modified, but only for good reason.
