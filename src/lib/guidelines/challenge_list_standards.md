*Many of the rules are inspired by [the challenge list](https://challengelist.gd/challenges/) and [pointercrate](https://pointercrate.com/)*
*These guidelines are subject to change and exceptions can be made unless otherwise stated*

# Challenge List Level Guidelines
## *You can submit your level to be potentially placed in <#1159629957031534654> *
*The list team has the final say in the placement of levels*

## Restrictions
> A challenge may be any length under **30 seconds**; no exceptions.
>
> It also cannot contain any **micro clicks** as it cannot be done on some hardware.
>
> Challenges may also not be **"spam based"**. This means that a significant part of the challenge's difficult is from having high CPS. Spams may be allowed if timings make up the difficulty and not CPS, or if the CPS does not contribute too much to the level difficulty. This will be judged on a case-by-base basis.
>
> A challenge must also not be **invisible **in order to detect noclip.
>
> Challenges must also not be **minigame **levels and should play like a regular geometry dash level

## Copied levels
> Challenges may be made by copying other levels, or parts of other levels, provided that they follow these rules:
> - The level must be verified in its own copy and not a start position.
> - If the level that the challenge it copied from is created by someone in this server, you must have **explicit permission** for the challenge to be placed. The original creator and request to have the level removed at any time.
> - The level may not be a low-effort copy. It should modify the gameplay or change the deco enough that it isn't the exact same as the original
> - If the original level is already on the list, it will be replaced by the new level
>

## Redundancy
> If two levels are very similar, the harder level will remain on the list and the easier one will be removed

## Standards
> These standards are not strictly enforced, but will be used to help determine whether a level should be placed or not. Although there is no minimum length requirement, levels that are very short and that also do not require many inputs will be unlikely to be placed. Challenges should also not be extremely low effort. Layouts are fine as long the gameplay is not extremely lazy. (e.g. copy and pasted straight fly). The gameplay of a level is usually a bigger factor than deco when determining if a level is placed or not, but having some deco (can be very basic) can allow it to be placed more easily.
