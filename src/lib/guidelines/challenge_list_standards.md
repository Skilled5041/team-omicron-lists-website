_Many of the rules are inspired by [the challenge list](https://challengelist.gd/challenges/) and [pointercrate](https://pointercrate.com/)_
_These guidelines are subject to change and exceptions can be made unless otherwise stated_

# Challenge List Level Guidelines

## _You can submit your level to be potentially placed in <#1159629957031534654> _

_The list team has the final say in the placement of levels_

## Restrictions

> A challenge may be any length under **30 seconds**; no exceptions.
>
> It also cannot contain any **micro clicks** as it cannot be done on some hardware.
>
> Challenges may also not be **"spam based"**. This means that a significant part of the challenge's difficult is from having high CPS. Spams may be allowed if timings make up the difficulty and not CPS, or if the CPS does not contribute too much to the level difficulty. This will be judged on a case-by-base basis.
>
> A challenge must also not be **invisible **in order to detect noclip.
>
> Challenges must also not be **minigame **levels and should play like a regular geometry dash level

## Copied levels

> Challenges may be made by copying other levels, or parts of other levels, provided that they follow these rules:
>
> -   The level must be verified in its own copy and not a start position.
> -   If the level that the challenge it copied from is created by someone in this server, you must have **explicit permission** for the challenge to be placed. The original creator and request to have the level removed at any time.
> -   The level may not be a low-effort copy. It should modify the gameplay or change the deco enough that it isn't the exact same as the original
> -   If the original level is already on the list, it will be replaced by the new level

## Redundancy

> If two levels are very similar, the harder level will remain on the list and the easier one will be removed

## Standards

> The gameplay of a challenge does not have be balanced or fun; challenges are intended to be hard. There are no requirements for the gameplay and decoration quality of a challenge, however we may choose to not accept challenges if they are clearly low-effort, or if they are made to spam the list.
