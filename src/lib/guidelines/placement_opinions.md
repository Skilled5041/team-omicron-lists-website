# Player Reliability
Players' opinions may be weighted differently depending on their reliability. Players will be asked by the team to self-assess their reliability for each of their opinions on a scale of 0 to 10. Here are some factors that players should consider:
- **Verifications:** verifiers and play-testers of a level may be biased
- **Outliers:** opinions that are drastically different from the other opinions may be omitted or weighted less
- **Previous Experience:** players who do not have many list levels completed may have their opinions weighted less
- **Level Experience:** players that have fluked or are unlucky with a level may have weight opinions weighted less
- **Time Between Completions:** if a player compares the difficulty between levels, the time between completions will be considered as players' skill levels can quickly improve

# Player Exclusions
Players that intentionally provide inaccurate opinions will not have their opinions considered. Players may also choose to not provide an opinion. 

# Low Detail Mode
If a level has a built-in LDM that make the level easier, that version of the level will be considered for the difficulty.

# Opinion Analysis
The placement of the level will be decided based on a weighted mean of all the opinions. Opinions may be excluded in some cases. The weighted average does not always dictate the exact placements of levels, and the difficulty of existing levels will also be considered.
