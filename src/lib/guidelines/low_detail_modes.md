# Low Detail Modes

## Built-in

Records that use the built-in Low Detail Mode (LDM) or a level will always be accepted. This is true even if the LDM significantly makes the level easier.

**There are no exceptions to this,** so the placement of a level will be based on the easiest method of completing the current version on the servers. This also applies to separate LDMs that creators publish for their levels.

## Team Omicron Account

The Team Omicron account (the username is `TeamOmicron`) on the Geometry Dash servers may publish LDMs of levels. LDMs published on the Team Omicron account will always be eligible.

# Custom LDMs

Some demons do not have a built-in LDM or an LDM on the Team Omicron account, or the existing LDMs still lag. In these cases, players may choose to create their own LDMs.

Players should clear any custom LDMs with the list team before using them to achieve records, especially if there is already an existing LDM. Some LDMs may be considered nerfs and are not allowed.

Players that need to clear an LDM with the team should share a hacked run of the level, so the team and quickly look at the level. Sharing a level ID is not recommended.

Players may also choose to play on an LDM created by someone outside the list team. You should also clear these LDMs with the list team using the same procedure previously mentioned. Even if an LDM has been accepted in the past, you should always check if the list team as the guidelines may have changed.

## Custom LDM Guidelines

-   You may not delete or alter any object that obstructs the player's vision. This includes certain transitions, screen flashes, and foreground decoration.
-   There is no fixed limit or required detail, but the LDM should not resemble a layout of the level.
-   Background deletions are only allowed if it does not impact the visibility of the gameplay
-   If the player chooses to remove the end screen of a level, the new length of the LDM should be the exact same as the original

## Colour Changes

Significant colour changes to the level are not allowed, but minor changes are allowed given that the difficulty of the level remains the same. This is evaluated on a case-by-case basis, so be sure to check with the list team.

## Smooth Fix

Smooth fix is never allowed as it can slow down the level, similar to using speedhacks.

## Texture Packs

Any texture packs that make the difficulty of a level easier are not allowed. Texture packs that visibility alter hitboxes (e.g. spikes, but not player icons) are not allowed. Players are also not allowed to use texture packs that make the in-game endscreen impossible to read.

## Shaders

A shader is any external software that alters the visual appearance of the game, such as reshade. All shaders are **not allowed** for any records.
