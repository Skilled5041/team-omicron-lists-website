# Raw Footage

### All records are required to have raw footage.

## Definition

Raw footage is the original file taken from the player's recording software, without any edits. This includes, trimming the video, or editing the audio.

## Video Compression

The video may not be intentionally compressed in any way. The video may only be compressed if the video hosting service that you use automatically compresses it (e.g., YouTube). However, the video should not be compressed too much, and records with overly compressed raw footage will be rejected.

## Censorship

If the raw footage has any cuts or splices in the video or audio, it will usually be rejected. Minor edits such as censoring or blurring personal information may be permitted. If you plan to submit raw footage with parts of it censored, please describe it in detail in the notes section of the submission form.

## Requirements for Raw Footage

-   Visible in-game endscreen
-   Audible clicks
-   Full attempt of record

## Live Streams

Players that use live streams to record their progress mat choose to link an unedited live stream instead of raw footage. However, players should be able to prove that it is unedited.

## Handcams

Handcams are not required for most levels, but the raw footage may also include a handcam. A handcam is defined as a clear, continuous view, of the player's input device. A handcam will greatly accept the legitimacy of a record. A handcam may cover up parts of the video, but it cannot block anything important (e.g, FPS counter, the in-game player).

## Liveplays

Raw footage may also optionally include a liveplay. A liveplay is when an external camera records the computer screen for the entire session. Liveplays will only be considered as additional evidence only if the input device is visible during the majority of the recording. Liveplays will also greatly support the legitimacy of a record. Liveplays that result in low visibility of the screen will result in the liveplay not being considered. If you have questions about the visibility of a liveplay setup, contact the list team.

A liveplay may be submitted instead of raw footage, or it can be submitted with raw footage, by including the liveplay in the notes section of the submission form.
